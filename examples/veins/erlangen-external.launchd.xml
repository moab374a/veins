<!--
Veins Launch Configuration for External SUMO Orchestrator

Purpose: Configuration file that tells Veins where to find SUMO simulation files
and how to set them up for the external SUMO orchestrator.

Key Configuration:
- basedir: Points to .......... where external orchestrator can access files
- copy elements: Define which SUMO files to copy to the working directory
- Files are accessible to host SUMO orchestrator at ...........

This solves the basedir path issue by using a host-accessible directory.

    <!--
    Base Directory Configuration
    This is the crucial setting that fixes the external SUMO orchestrator access issue.

    - Container path: Files are copied here inside container
    - Host path: External orchestrator finds files at ...........
    - The volume mount in docker-compose makes these the same location
    -->


    <basedir path="/home/moab374a/simulation-workspace/software/veins/examples/veins/" />




    <!--
    Random Seed for Reproducibility
    Set to 0 for default behavior, or specify a number for reproducible results
    -->
    <seed value="0" />

    <!--
    File Copy Configuration
    These files are copied from the examples/veins/ directory to the basedir
    so the external SUMO orchestrator can access them
    -->

    <!-- Network topology file (roads, junctions, etc.) -->
    <copy file="erlangen.net.xml" />

    <!-- Route definitions (vehicle paths and timing) -->
    <copy file="erlangen.rou.xml" />

    <!-- Polygon definitions (buildings, areas for visualization) -->
    <copy file="erlangen.poly.xml" />

    <!--
    Main SUMO configuration file
    type="config" means this is the primary configuration file that SUMO will load
    -->
    <copy file="erlangen.sumo.cfg" type="config" />
